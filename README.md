Machine Condition Reporting Website - HTML, CSS, and JS

Welcome to the Machine Condition Reporting Website project! This website allows registered users to report on machine conditions. If the user is not registered, they will be redirected to an error page asking them to register first. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

How it Works:

Token Verification:
Upon accessing the reporting page, JavaScript checks if a valid token is present in the local storage.
User Authentication:
If a valid token is found, the user is considered registered and is allowed to access the reporting page.
If no token is found or the token is invalid, the user is redirected to the error page asking them to register.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure of the reporting page and error page.
CSS: Styles the pages for a visually appealing user experience.
JavaScript: Handles token verification and user authentication.
How to Use:

Access the Reporting Page:
Navigate to the reporting page of the website.
Token Verification:
JavaScript will verify if a valid token is present in the local storage.
User Authentication:
If registered, the reporting page will open.
If not registered, the user will be redirected to the error page asking them to register first.
